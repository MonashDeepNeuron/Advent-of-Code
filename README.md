# Advent-of-Code

Solutions to Advent of Code (AoC) by various members and contributors of MDN.

## Contributing a Solution

If you whish to contribute a solution to a particular AoC challenge, create a new directory with your first and last name; separated by a hyphen and in all lowercase in that challenge's corresponding year and day directories.

> eg. If you want to contribute a solution to AoC 2022, Day 08 you would create new directory `first-last` in `2022/day-08`. If this challenge has no solutions yet, then you will have to create the top level directories.

Within your named directory you can place your solution(s) in whatever format/structure you desire. You can have everything dumped in the directory or organise it by language (if you contributed in multiple languages) or even link your solution as a Git submodules. However, your solution must have:

- A `README.md` file indicating how to build and run your solution. You can make one for each language (if applicable) or put every language build instructions in the same file at the root of your named directory.
- A `LICENSE` file that contains the copyrights of your solution. Can be a different license for each language. If a `LICENSE` file is at the root of your named directory then it will be assumed to apply for any source code in that directory and/or in any sub-directories that do not contain an individual `LICENSE` file of their own.
- A copyright notice as a code comment at top (or in a language's specifically desired location) of any source files indicating who the copyright holder is of the following source code and the license it is under. it may also include a brief description of the problem and the solution and a link to the location of the sources origin (ie. your personal repository containing the solution).

Once you have added your solution, commit the changes onto a new branch following the name convention `first-last-YYYY-dayDD` and create a pull request to merge your solution into the repository.

Next you will want to add your solution(s) to this weeks catchup slides. To edit the slides properly you will need to use Powerpoint (ask us if you need help with this). Within the slide deck, create a new section in the slides with your name and add your solutions to a slides (one for each language). Alternatively you can also use multiple slides for a single language if you have multiple approaches or iterations. At the bottom of your slides, add a link to your repository hosting the solution.
