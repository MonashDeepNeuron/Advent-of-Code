# Contributions

Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
Any and all contributions are always very much appreciated. However, to make sure the process of accepting patches goes for everyone (especially for the maintainer), you should try to follow these few simple guidelines when you contribute:

## Steps to Contribute

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a branch following the naming convention `first-last` where `first-last` is you first and last name. Easiest way is run `git checkout -b first-last`.
3. Update the Markdown file(s) corresponding with the year(s) of your solutions with your name, link to the host repo and a status badge as a Markdown list item/dot point [example](#example).
4. Commit your changes and when you are ready create a Pull Request (PR) on Github into the `main` branch from your new branch. Once approved your repository with your solution will be linked and can be browsed by anyone.

### Example

eg. As Markdown

```markdown
- First Last [<GitHub-username>\<repo-name>](https://github.com/github-username/repo-name) ![Last Commit on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/github-username/repo-name.svg)
```

eg. Rendered

- Tyler Swann [oraqlle\AoC](https://github.com/oraqlle/AoC>) ![Last Commit on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/oraqlle/AoC.svg)

### Notes

- If your language is not present add a new heading with your language (keep the language order alphabetical) and update the index at the top of the file.
- If the year file hasn't been created, copy the `YYYY-template.md` file and update the year and its name accordingly.
